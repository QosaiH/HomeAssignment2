            <h2 class="h2">CRISTIANO RONALDO</h2>
            <p>
                Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional
                footballer who plays as a forward for
                and captains both Saudi Professional League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely
                regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3]
                and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his career,
                including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the
                UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances , goals , and assists in the
                Champions League, goals in the European Championship , men's international goals , and men's
                international appearances . He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career
                appearances, and has scored over 800 official senior career goals for club and country.


                Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003,
                winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League
                titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or.
                Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for
                Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and
                formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning
                four Champions League wins from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won
                back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three
                times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top
                goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's
                top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won two La Liga
                titles, two Copas del Rey, four Champions Leagues, three UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups.
                In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most
                expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A
                titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most
                Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and
                Italian leagues, before returning to Manchester United in 2021. He left in 2022, after his contract
                with the club was terminated. In 2023, Ronaldo signed for Al Nassr.
                <br>
                Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned over
                190 caps, making him Portugal's most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level,
                he is also the all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at 11 major tournaments; he
                scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He
                assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese
                player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to
                their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest
                goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also
                led them to a third-place finish at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and to victory in the inaugural
                UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the
                Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.
