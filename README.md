My website is about Cristiano Ronaldo. It includes 4 pages about him:
1. Home Page with his photo.
2. About Page with a short paragraph about his life and the clubs he has played for.
3. Skills and Gallery Page that includes different links leading to his own pages and skills/interview videos.
4. Rewards Page showing his different awards and achievements.
5. Challenges Faced:
It was my first time using JavaScript, and I had to choose a way to include it in my project and style the navigation bar.
New CSS Properties: The Skills and Gallery page was difficult to create because it includes different sizes of pictures and has links and short titles, similar to the Rewards page. I had to use nested divs to successfully achieve this layout.
