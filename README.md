my website is about Cristiano Ronaldo its includes 4 pages abot him:
1. Home page whit his photo
2. About page short paragraph about his life and clubs that he played for.
3. Skills and gallery page that includes a diffrent links that lead to his own pages and skills/interview videos.
4. Reward page showing his diffrent awards claim.
chllanges that I faced:
it was first time what I use JavaScript and I had to choose a way to incloude it to my project and style the nav bar.
new css properties:
the Skills and gallery page was hard to make because it inculde a diffrent sizes of pictures and have a link and short title, similar to rewards. I had to make div in div to succes do this.
