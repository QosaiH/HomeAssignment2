            <h1 class="h"><u>Ballon d'Or Award</u></h1>
            <p> legend of world football, Pelé, was responsible for announcing that
                Cristiano Ronaldo was
                the winner of the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or at the FIFA awards ceremony in Zurich.
                <br>The Portuguese is the complete footballer. The eye for goal he demonstrated time
                and time again last
                year is just one of his assets on the pitch. Real Madrid and Portugal's leader,
                the forward has done
                more than enough to earn one of the most prestigious individual prizes on offer
                from the Fedération
                Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) making him the best player in the
                world.

            <p class=>Ronaldo also was notnamed on the list of nominees, failing to make
                thefinal shortlist. He won
                the first FIFA Best Men's Player of the Year awards in 2016 and 2017.
                <br>Cristiano Ronaldo lifted the 2015/16 ChampionsLeague with Real Madrid and was the
                tournament's top
                goalscorer with 16 goals in 12 appearances. Beforethenewseason kicked off, the
                striker helped
                hisclub wintheEuropeanSuper Cup. he also captained Portugal to their first-ever
                major international
                trophy when they beat Antoine Griezmann's France to lift Euro 2016.

            <h1 class="h"><u> Golden Shoe Award</u></h1>
            <p class=>Cristiano Ronaldo is second on the all time list, having won four Golden
                Shoes, as well as two
                consecutively. His record is 48 goals and 96 points respectively, in 2014–15.
                Gerd Müller was the
                first player to win the award twice, in 1970 and 1972. Eusébio was the first
                winner of the prize in
                1968.
                <br>Ronaldo becomes the fourth player to receive the trophy on four different
                occasions—that's one more
                than Barcelona's Lionel Messi and two more than the likes of Eusebio, Gerd
                Mliler and Thierry Henry.
